    <summary>Detecting and Mitigating Jamming Attacks in IoT Networks Using Self-Adaptation</summary>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Internet of Things (IoT) networks consist of small devices that use a wireless communication to monitor and possibly control the physical world. A common threat to such networks are jamming attacks, a particular type of denial of service attack. Current research highlights the need for the design of more effective and efficient anti-jamming techniques that can handle different types of attacks in IoT networks. In this paper, we propose DeMiJA, short for Detection and Mitigation of Jamming Attacks in IoT, a novel approach to deal with different jamming attacks in IoT networks. DeMiJA leverages architecture-based adaptation and the MAPE-K reference model (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute that share Knowledge). We present the general architecture of DeMiJA and instantiate the architecture to deal with jamming attacks in the DeltaIoT exemplar. The evaluation shows that DeMiJA can handle different types of jamming attacks effectively and efficiently, with neglectable overhead.</p>

    <summary>Overcoming the Challenge of Evasive Malware: Building a Comprehensive Dataset for Detection and Analysis</summary>
    <blockquote>
        <p>This thesis presents the development of a specialized dataset focusing on evasive malware - malicious software programs designed to circumvent traditional analysis methods through various strategies known as as evasion techniques. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, the need for a dedicated dataset to study these evasion techniques is essential for advancing the analysis of malicious software and enhancing cybersecurity. Existing public datasets often mix evasive and non-evasive malware samples, complicating efforts to isolate and study evasion techniques. This research addresses that gap by providing a curated, graph-based database exclusively containing evasive malware, categorized according to a detailed taxonomy of evasion methods. The dataset was compiled using an enhanced version of the CAPEv2 malware analysis sandbox, which was improved through a methodology developed in this work to identify currently undetected evasion techniques. When applied to CAPEv2, this approach uncovered techniques that were previously undetectable, which are now within the enhanced tool's detection capabilities. Key contributions of this thesis include the creation of an up-to-date taxonomy of evasion techniques, the development of a methodology for detecting currently undetected evasion techniques in existing analysis tools, the resulting improvements to CAPEv2's detection capabilities, and a dataset containing exclusively evasive malware samples. This dataset represents a significant contribution to the field, offering researchers a valuable resource to study evasion techniques and develop new evasion detection strategies. The graph-based structure of the database, along with the modeling of the taxonomy, enables intuitive and flexible querying across various abstraction levels, detailed analysis, and easy expansion as new techniques are identified. By offering a focused resource for studying evasive malware and a robust methodology for enhancing detection tools, this work lays the groundwork for more effective analysis methods, ultimately contributing to stronger defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.</p>
